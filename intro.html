                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Hi there! It's me Debtanaya. I am a 23-year-old aspiring developer, driven by a deep passion for innovation and a desire to create positive change in the world. As a software developer and data enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the power of technology to solve problems and drive business success. But my interests go far beyond of technical proficiency - I am a lifelong student, always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in a wide variety of fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For me, learning is not just a means to an end - it is a lifelong pursuit that I find endlessly fulfilling. I believe that the best way to grow and develop is through a combination of experience, formal training, and self-directed learning
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, my goal is to use my skills and knowledge to co-create value with others, and to contribute to my country's emergence as a global superpower. I believe that the key to achieving this lies in fostering collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to lifelong learning, and I am excited to continue on this journey of growth and discovery
                    </p>
